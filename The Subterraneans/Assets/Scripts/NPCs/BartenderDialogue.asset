  randomDialogue:
  - Used to be a lotta good folk up on the surface. Not much left of that now. I
    ain't never seen a town so eager to bury itself... but gold, well, that makes
    folks do strange things, don't it?
  - "I ain't never seen a soul come down here and stay this long without somethin'
    gnawin' at 'em. Don\u2019t let the quiet fool ya it\u2019ll start talkin' to
    you. That mine... it has a way of gettin' under your skin, friend."
  - "They say the moonshine\u2019ll heal a body, but I ain't seen it do much for
    the soul. Don't get too attached to it... it ain't all it's cracked up to be.
    Trust me, I been around long enough to know."
  - "Used to have a dog... real loyal fella. Never left my side 'til the mines started
    takin\u2019 more than just gold. If yer dog\u2019s got the right spirit, you
    might just make it outta here in one piece. Might."
  - "I\u2019ve poured this 'shine for many a prospector, but they don't tell ya what
    it costs. When yer face starts to change, and yer bones start to ache, you\u2019ll
    wish you\u2019d never tasted the stuff. But I ain't here to warn ya. I'm here
    to serve."
  - "Some folks up top talked about us like we was ghosts. Well, we are. Ain't no
    place for a living soul down here anymore, not really. Just shadows, wanderin'
    and whisperin\u2019 in the dark, keepin' their eyes on the gold."
  - "Y'know, they used to say the moonshine would make ya stronger, live longer,
    but every sip comes with a cost. The more ya drink, the less you remember...
    or maybe it\u2019s the less you care. Ain\u2019t nobody up here rememberin' much
    no more."
  - "I keep pourin' drinks, keep the light on... but when the moon hits right, the
    shadows get long. You might start hearin' things. I sure do. Been here long enough
    to know that\u2019s when the past comes knockin'."
  - I can tell by your eyes you ain't from around here. So, let me give ya some advice,
    don't go wanderin' too deep, not if you value your skin. What you think's just
    a mine is somethin' else entirely... and it don't take kindly to strangers.
  storyDialogue:
  - "\"Down in them deep mines, you'll find mushrooms sproutin' up. Mix 'em in with
    my 'shine... well, that\u2019s when the real trouble starts.\""
  - '"Now, don''t forget to fetch me some the next time you come across ''em."'
  unlockDoubleJump: "\"Here, take this brew. It'll give ya an extra leap, but don\u2019t
    go thinkin\u2019 it comes free. Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 ever is down here. Just
    be careful, friend, this place has a way of takin' more than you\u2019re ready
    to give.\""
  unlockDash: "This\u2019ll make you faster than a rattlesnake on a hot day. But
    speed ain't always a blessing, you know. Sometimes it just gets you deeper into
    trouble. Use it wisely... or you might find it leads you straight into the dark."
  unlockWallClimb: "Take this, and you'll be able to climb the walls like a critter
    on the hunt. But the higher you go, the further you fall. Ya might reach places
    you ain\u2019t meant to be, so keep your eyes on your feet when you start crawlin\u2019."
  unlockWallJump: "This\u2019ll let ya bounce off walls, like a spring-loaded trap.
    Ain\u2019t too different from what we used to do down here, trapped in cycles,
    jumpin' between shadows. Just don't get too used to the feelin\u2019 of flyin',
    \u2018cause the fall always comes."
