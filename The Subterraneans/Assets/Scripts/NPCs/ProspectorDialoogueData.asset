  randomDialogue:
  - You know, stranger, I once thought I could dig up enough gold to buy me a fine
    house, a big ol' piece of land, and a nice horse to ride around on. Turns out,
    all I got was a bad back and a lifetime of regrets
  - "The trick to finding gold, they say, is knowin\u2019 where to look. But, after
    years of lookin\u2019, I reckon it\u2019s more about knowin\u2019 where to stop
    lookin\u2019\u2014and that\u2019s somewhere way back at the start of this here
    town."
  - You can hear the old town above us, if you listen real close. The wind through
    the broken buildings... like the ghosts of those who left. I reckon they got
    out, but we... we just stayed.
  - "Heh, we\u2019ve been down here so long, we don\u2019t even remember what daylight
    looks like. You think the world still turns up there? Maybe it forgot about us,
    or maybe we just forgot about it."
  - "Everyone came down here for gold, but it didn\u2019t take long for the gold
    to stop matterin'. People got... comfortable in the dark. Maybe that\u2019s why
    we never left. It\u2019s hard to go back to the surface when you\u2019ve grown
    used to the shadows."
  - "If you\u2019re curious about how we live down here, it\u2019s pretty simple.
    Trap animals, boil \u2018em up, brew that moonshine, and keep the light burnin\u2019.
    It ain\u2019t much, but it\u2019s all we got. And you\u2019ll need some of that
    light if you\u2019re gonna make it down here, believe me."
  - "This moonshine ain't just booze, it\u2019s the last thing that keeps us holdin'
    on to what we used to be. Gives you strength, sure, but it also takes something
    back. The deeper you drink, the less you are of yourself, until all you're left
    with is what it wants you to be."
  - "Folks used to call us miners, but after all these years in the dark, I reckon
    we ain\u2019t much different from those Morlocks you read about in the old books.
    We\u2019ve been buried so long, the light of the surface don\u2019t even feel
    like a memory anymore. And the darker it gets, the more we become like them,
    hunting what we can, always searching, always hungry."
  storyDialogue:
  - "Well, well, looks like you\u2019re headed into that dark hole, huh? You might
    wanna take one of these lanterns off our hands before you get yourself lost in
    there. It\u2019s mighty dark in there, friend. And trust me, you ain't gonna
    find your way around without a little light. Heck, half the time, we can\u2019t
    even see our own feet without one."
  - "What my brother means to say is... it\u2019s gonna be a rough go of it without
    a proper light. And, well, we got a spare here. No sense in you trippin\u2019
    over your own feet in the dark. A little light could save you from the rats,
    or worse... the mines got a way of takin\u2019 people by surprise, if you catch
    my drift."

  purchaseSuccessful: "It\u2019ll light up the cave just fine, if you don\u2019t
    mind the smell of it. You\u2019ll smell like an old miner by the time you come
    out, though."

    but the sound of your own footsteps echoing."
